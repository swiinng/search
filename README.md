progress:
- start with corpus generator: multi format, multi encoding, multi language (english, html, etc)
- maybe add metadata to corpus and docs? (or add support for classifiers)
- add support for decoders, parsers, etc for the docs
- add support for how to split a corpus into docs (different strategies: one paragrahp, line , generalize this)

- maybe think about support for normalizers, stemmers, and tokenizers?
- also maybe think about ...forgot (but all other stuff to bootstrap search)

- add support for skip list inverted index
- add support for proximity search inverted index (/k)
